# Video-Piracy-Detection-and-Avoidance
This project's primary objective is to utilize machine learning and deep learning algorithms to identify instances of video piracy and prevent its occurrence. The approach involves employing both visible and invisible watermarks to deter unauthorized duplication, alongside strategies to mitigate camcording and screen recording.

For the input video and input image choose anything of your choice. It is not provided with the code. Output video will be generated automatically when the code is executed.
